# info_cube_viz
A first try implemetation of the information cube visualisation written in three.js. The final aim is to make it
modular and mountable (for example to a div on a page), also it would be nice if it could be used independently 
of WebGL framework. Contributions are welcome, to contribute fork the repo and then make a pull request (tests for the feature are recommended).
